# Synk (MyDiscussionForum Website)
## By Ved Ballary and Aaron Deo
# The Problem
As avid music enthusiasts we don’t only love listening to music, we love sharing our new finds with our friends. However, due to the difference in the platforms, sharing new songs and creating shared playlists with our friends is a cumbersome process. We firmly believe that music is the root of unity and the division caused by the streaming platforms ecosystems have contrasted the most powerful aspect of music.

# Our Solution
SYNK solves this problem by creating a central platform where everyone can add their favorite songs to a playlist, regardless of streaming platform. These songs would be automatically synced to a playlist of their streaming platforms choice. Since some music streaming platforms don’t allow for a user to engage with community created playlists and music, we allow for our blog to facilitate this interaction. A user would propose their playlist theme/ideas via blog post, other users could then interact with the blog post by commenting songs which are then added to the playlist automatically.
